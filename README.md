# Code-of-Conduct

CODE OF CONDUCT 

The CODE Workshop works to create a community with a common agenda, cause, and interests, who collaborate by sharing ideas, information, and resources. It is of paramount importance to the CODE Workshop planning committee that each and every person attending our virtual events has a positive and rewarding experience. To that end, we are committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment for all event participants. 
We have worked with the Computer Science in Modern Biology workshop to establish this Virtual Events Code of Conduct to provide guidelines to participants and to ensure that all participants understand what behavior is expected, and what behavior will not be tolerated. All participants, including, but not limited to, attendees, speakers, CODE Workshop staff/committee members, exhibitors/sponsors, and all others are expected to abide by this Virtual Events Code of Conduct.
The CODE Workshop has zero-tolerance for any form of discrimination or harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment by participants or our staff/committee at our meetings. 
If you experience harassment or hear of any incidents of unacceptable behavior, the CODE Workshop asks that you inform us by direct email at codeworkshopou@gmail.com, so that we can take the appropriate action. 

UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR IS DEFINED AS:
•	Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form. 
•	Verbal abuse of any attendee, speaker, exhibitor/sponsor, CODE Workshop staff or committee members, service provider, or another event guest. 
•	Examples of verbal abuse include but are not limited to, verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations, or threatening or stalking any attendee, speaker, exhibitor/sponsor, CODE Workshop staff/committee members, service provider, or other meeting guests. 
•	Disruption of presentations during sessions or any virtual meetups or events throughout the virtual experience. All participants must comply with the instructions of the moderator and any CODE Workshop virtual event staff. 
•	Presentations, postings, and messages should not contain promotional materials, special offers, job offers, product announcements, or solicitation for services. The CODE Workshop reserves the right to remove such messages and potentially ban sources of those solicitations. 
•	Participants should not copy or take screenshots of Q&A or any chat room activity that takes place in the virtual space. 

CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR 
The CODE Workshop reserves the right to take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, including immediate removal from the virtual meeting without warning, in response to any incident of unacceptable behavior, and the CODE Workshop reserves the right to prohibit attendance at any future meeting, virtually or in person. 
A participant who believes they are falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct should notify the Workshop email with a concise description of the grievance. All grievances will be handled in accordance with existing governing policies.
